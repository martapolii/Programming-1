will calculate and display the area according to the
formula (area = 3.14 * radius * radius). You must accept
fractions as the input. If the user enters 1.2 for the
radius then the area will be 4.52. (Use the "F" format-specifier for floating point values).

            Use the Convert.ToDouble() method to obtain a double from an input.
