This repository contains the assignments and projects I completed in the Programming I (COMP-100) course at Centennial College. This course provided a solid introduction to programming, covering fundamental concepts such as program structures, logic, and good coding practices using C# .NET.

Key Skills Developed:
- Understanding and applying basic programming concepts and logic.
- Designing and implementing business applications in C# .NET.
- Using control structures (if statements, loops) to manage program flow.
- Working with data types, variables, and arrays to manage data.
- Creating and using methods, including parameter passing and return values.
- Designing simple classes and working with objects in C#.
- 
Topics I Covered:
- Programming Concepts and Algorithm Design
- Variables and Data Types (Including Arrays)
- Program Control Structures (If, Else, Switch)
- Looping Structures (While, For, Do-While)
- Methods and Parameter Passing
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- Basic Input and Output Operations
- Error Handling and Debugging
  
This repo highlights my journey through the foundational concepts of programming, with practical assignments that solidify my understanding of C# and object-oriented programming.
