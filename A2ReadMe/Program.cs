         Hi Professor! I named all the questions after the following format: "A2Question01" (A2 for Assignment 2) because I had 
        made previous projects called "Question01"/"question01" and even after changing the names and deleting folders with these names, I still get the error that this "this directory is not empty," and it would not let me make new projects with those names. I have tried troubleshooting and have not yet found a solution.
